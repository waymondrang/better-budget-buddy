## How It Works

As a browser extension, BudgetBuddy has permission to view information and manipulate the [eAccounts Account Transactions page](https://eacct-ucsd-sp.transactcampus.com/eAccounts/AccountTransaction.aspx). BudgetBuddy also has permission to store data locally in the browser and open new tabs. No user data, including analytics data, is sent from the extension.

## Installation

To install BudgetBuddy, either pull/clone the repository or download as .zip. If necessary, unzip the file, then navigate to the Chrome Extensions page at `chrome://extensions/`.

Once on the Chrome Extensions page, enable **Developer Mode** using the toggle on the top-right of the page, revealing a button drawer.

Select **Load Unpacked** and locate the folder with the contents of BudgetBuddy. BudgetBuddy should now appear under the list of installed extensions. Make sure that the version of your installed BudgetBuddy matches the most up to date version.

Congrats, you've installed BudgetBuddy!
